<h2>Re: Eileen Dover university application</h2>

<p>Dear Eileen,</p>
<p>
    Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's  
    science faculty to study as part of your

    next year. I will answer your questions one by one,
    in the following sections.</p>

<h3>Starting dates</h3>

<h3>Subjects of study</h3>

<p>At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-mided research facility- as long a the subjects fall
    somehwere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just
    the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued by are as follows, in order of priority:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of Resvertrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O <sub>3</sub>)</li>
    <li>Measuring the effect o performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30<sup>o</sup>C (86<sup>o</sup>F), when the audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 X 10<sup>3</sup> increasing to 3 x 10<sup>4</sup>.)</li>
    <li> <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheet">CSS</abbr> constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
</ol>

<p> So please you can provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the reseacrh to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks</p>

<h3>Exotic dance moves</h3>

<p>Yes, you are rigt! As part of my post-doctorate work, I did study exotic tribal dances. To answer your quetsions, <br> my favorite
    dances are as follows, with definitions:
</p>

<dl>
    <dt>Polynesian chicken dance</dt>
    <dd>A littel known but <em>very</em> influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village would dance around <br>in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful."</dd>

    <dt>Icelandic brownian shuffle</dt>
    <dd>Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which <br>
        involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, shuffling their bodies around in imperceptibly tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired modern styles such as Twerking</dd>
    <dt>Artic robot dance</dt>
    <dd>An intereting exaple of historuc misinformation, English explores in the 1960s believed to have discovered a new dance style characterised by <q>robotic</q>, stilled movements, being practiced by inhabitants <br>
         of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this because they were really cold</dd>

<p>Yours sincerely,</p>
